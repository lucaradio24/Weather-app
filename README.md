## 🛠️ Built With

- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Pure JS without frameworks
- **Modern CSS** - Grid, Flexbox, custom properties
- **Vite** - Build tooling and development server
- **Swiper.js** - Carousel interactions
- **Weather APIs** - Visual Crossing (data) & WeatherAPI (autocomplete search)

## 🎯 What I Learned

- **REST API integration** and error handling
- **Responsive design** principles and implementation
- **ES6 modules** and modern JavaScript patterns
- **State management** without external libraries

## 📱 Status

### ✅ Works Great
- Desktop experience
- Search functionality
- Theme switching
- Reliable weather data

### ⚠️ Could Improve
- Occasional slow loading times
- Mobile touch gestures
- Code organization
- Error states

## 🔮 Next Steps

- [ ] Better mobile gesture handling
- [ ] Code refactoring and cleanup
- [ ] Progressive Web App features
- [ ] Weather maps integration

## 🙏 Reflection

This project taught me more about real web development than any tutorial. I learnt from every bug, I did use stuff I didn't study yet and learnt it through doing, but I'm genuinely proud of building something complete and functional.

Building the responsive design and API integration from scratch gave me solid foundations in modern web development.
