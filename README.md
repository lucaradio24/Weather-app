## 🛠️ Built With

- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks, pure JS fundamentals
- **Modern CSS** - Grid, Flexbox, custom properties
- **Vite** - Build tooling and development server
- **Swiper.js** - Carousel interactions
- **Weather APIs** - Visual Crossing (data) & WeatherAPI (search) integration

## 🎯 What I Learned

- **REST API integration** and error handling
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach
- **ES6 modules** and modern JavaScript patterns
- **State management** without external libraries

## 📱 Current Status

**✅ Works Great:** 
- Desktop experience, search functionality, theme switching, reliable weather data

**⚠️ Could Improve:** 
- Occasional slow loading times, mobile touch gestures, code organization, error states

## 🔮 Next Steps

- [ ] Better mobile gesture handling
- [ ] Code refactoring and cleanup
- [ ] Progressive Web App features
- [ ] Weather maps integration

## 🙏 Reflection

This project taught me more about real web development than any tutorial. I learned from every bug, used technologies I hadn't studied yet and learned them through doing. I'm genuinely proud of building something complete and functional.

Building the responsive design and API integration from scratch gave me solid foundations in modern web development.
